      My name is Alejandro Torres, and you can just call me Alejandro. I’m 17 years old and I’m from the Dominican Republic. I live in La Vega with my family. I don’t have much work experience yet, but I’ve helped my uncle in his hardware store during the weekends. My dream is to become an architect and design sustainable buildings that help protect the environment. I’d love to learn how to use design software like AutoCAD and improve my English. I haven’t traveled abroad, but I’d love to visit Spain and Japan someday. I speak Spanish fluently and I’m learning English at school. I really enjoy adventure books, superhero movies, and rap music. I’m good at drawing, especially buildings and landscapes, and I have a talent for working with my hands. I like biking, watching documentaries, and building things, but I’m not a big fan of loud parties or waiting in long lines. In my free time, I enjoy sketching, listening to music, and playing basketball with my friends.

      My name is Emily Rodríguez, but you can simply call me Emily. I am 18 years old and proudly Dominican. I currently live in Santiago, Dominican Republic. I worked as a part-time cashier at a grocery store, but right now, I’m focused on my studies. My biggest dream is to become a travel writer and explore every continent. I’m especially eager to learn French and improve my photography skills. I’ve been to Punta Cana, but I hope to one day visit Paris and Tokyo. Spanish is my native language, and I’m currently learning English. I really enjoy reading mystery novels, watching romantic comedies, and listening to pop music. I consider myself creative, especially when it comes to writing and drawing, and I’m also comfortable with public speaking. I love nature walks, painting, and dancing, although I dislike being in disorganized or noisy places. In my free time, I enjoy journaling, watching movies, and spending time with friends.

      Hi, I’m Marcus Lee, but feel free to call me Marcus. I’m 21 years old and I come from the United States. At the moment, I live in Chicago. I’ve had some experience working in customer service and retail, and I’m now a full-time university student.

My favorite books are science fiction, I enjoy action movies, and I listen to a mix of electronic and jazz music. I’m skilled at problem-solving, coding, and organizing events.
